            <h2>Clever Class Poem</h2>
            <p>
                <span>Up Learning’s ladder, round by round</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">We’ve climbed with many a fall;</span>
                <br/>
                <span>But, through the toil, companionship</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">Has made amends for all.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Now from our giddy heights we glance,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">With calm thoughts and serene,</span>
                <br/>
                <span>Once more at those we leave today⁠—</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">Our class of sweet sixteen.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>I want to take you with me through</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">The ranks of our small crowd;</span>
                <br/>
                <span>And, if you’ll listen carefully,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">You’ll know why we are proud</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Grace, as our goodly president</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">Has served her second year;</span>
                <br/>
                <span>In singing, speaking, poetry,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">She stands without a peer.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Blanche is the sunshine of our class,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">She drives dull care away</span>
                <br/>
                <span>Her laughing eyes, her smiling face,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">Have gladdened many a day</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Alice, the calm, the dignified,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">I know we’ll ne’er forget;</span>
                <br/>
                <span>Her views are wide⁠—⁠but, best of all,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">She is the teacher’s pet.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Lena excels in whispering.</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">Few are the notes she writes;</span>
                <br/>
                <span>She studies hard throughout the day,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">For pleasure, saves her nights.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Belle was the star in physics class,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">She always knew the laws</span>
                <br/>
                <span>And when she failed to know a thing,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">She always had a cause.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Anna has graced our piano stool,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">And mingled tunes with laughter;</span>
                <br/>
                <span>Ah, well, one can be young but once,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">The frowns may come hereafter.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Ruth is a clever, pretty girl,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">So everyone remarks,</span>
                <br/>
                <span>Yet lives in constant danger⁠—⁠what?</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">The danger of her “Sparks.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Will is the pride of all the girls,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">The slave of every teacher,</span>
                <br/>
                <span>When someone wants a window closed,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">She calls on “Jube,” poor creature.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Clayt is the lad who’s in to win,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">He is the teachers’ boy,</span>
                <br/>
                <span>And though at times his face is sad,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">His heart is full of “Joy.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Gertie has made a record proud,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">She seldom failed in class,</span>
                <br/>
                <span>She studied hard these last four years</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">And well deserved to pass.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Bertha, the singer of our class,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">How diligent she’s been!</span>
                <br/>
                <span>She did her share of whispering,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">But then that’s not a sin.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Bess is the class historian</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">That office, well, she’ll fill.</span>
                <br/>
                <span>She’s “Sortore” set in all her ways,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">And has an iron “Will.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Lawrence is the one who thinks</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">He’s been our comrade long;</span>
                <br/>
                <span>His fav’rite stone, an "Opal" bright</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">He’s blest with an “Arm strong.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Sweet Genevieve has worked and toiled,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">Her honor’s justly won,</span>
                <br/>
                <span>And every teacher in our school</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">Will say her work’s well “Dunn.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>And now there’s only one remains,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">He should have come before;</span>
                <br/>
                <span>His name is John, his hopes all lie</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">In a corner grocery store.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>And now, I’ve mentioned everyone,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">I hope no one feels slighted,</span>
                <br/>
                <span>But if one does, let him approach,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">His wrong will soon be righted.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>At last your poet ends his lay,</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">He’s nothing more to tell,</span>
                <br/>
                <span>But leaves the class of nineteen-one</span>
                <br/>
                <span class="i1">With blessing and farewell</span>
